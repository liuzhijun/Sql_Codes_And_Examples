# Sql_Codes_And_Examples
In this file I show examples of working in database with Sql. Here, I gave information about both reading and creating a database.

## NEW DATABASE
I created a database. I prepared their tables and entered their data.
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Sql_Codes_And_Examples/blob/main/tire_and_rim_shop1.sql).
I entered the sample data of the tables I created in the database.

## SELECT COMMAND AND CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. This process is called querying. The data returned by the SELECT command is stored in a table called the result set.
Here, I made filters in the database I created with the "where" command along with the select command. Among them, I also showed the " and&or , in, like, order by " queries.

## AGGREGATE FUNCTİON
Mathematical operations can be done with aggregate functions. We will use the "sum, count, avg, min-max" commands for these.
You can check this page [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Sql_Codes_And_Examples/blob/main/AggrageteFunction.sql).

## GROUP BY AND HAVİNG 
 It is used to divide the table or tables queried together into groups. It is also used in conjunction with aggragate functions.
 The having command has the same function as "where ", but we cannot use the "where" command because we use aggregate functions in group by statements. We use "having" for this.

## DML (Data Manipulating Language)
 It performs the operations of calling the information, adding something new to the information, deleting the information and updating the information.For this, we use the     "insert, update, delete" commands.
 You can check this page [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Sql_Codes_And_Examples/blob/main/DML(DataManipulatingLanguage).sql)

## DDL(DATA Definition Language)
It allows the creation, deletion and editing of some basic properties of tables, which are objects where data is kept.I used these when creating my database

## JOİN
It serves to create a result table by querying two or more tables at the same time. We can also use "group by" and "order by" expressions together.
